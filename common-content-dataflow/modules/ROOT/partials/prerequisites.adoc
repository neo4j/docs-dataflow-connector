This page gives you an overview of all the pieces you need before you can run a Dataflow job to import data into Neo4j.
// end::intro[]


// tag::neo4j[]
== Neo4j instance

You need a running Neo4j instance which the data can flow into.

If you don't have an instance yet, you have two options:

- sign-up for a free link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura-free/[AuraDB] instance
- install and self-host Neo4j in a location that is publicly accessible (see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/[Neo4j -> Installation]) with port 7687 open (Bolt protocol)

[IMPORTANT]
====
The template uses link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/constraints/[constraints], some of which are only available in Neo4j/Aura Enterprise Edition installations.
Although the Dataflow jobs are able to run **on Neo4j Community Edition instances, most constraints will not be created**.
You have thus to ensure that the source data and job specification are prepared accordingly.

// tag::connection-info[]
== Upload connection information

Regardless of how your Neo4j instance is deployed, you need to create a file containing your database connection information in JSON format.
We will refer to this file as `neo4j-connection-info.json`.
Dataflow will use the information contained in this file to connect to the Neo4j instance.

====
[.include-with-basic-auth]
=====
The basic authentication scheme relies on traditional username and password.
This scheme can also be used to authenticate against an LDAP server.

[source,json]
----
{
  "server_url": "neo4j+s://xxxx.databases.neo4j.io",
  "database": "neo4j",
  "username": "<username>",
  "pwd": "<password>"
}
----
=====

[.include-with-no-auth]
=====
If authentication is disabled on the server, credentials can be omitted.

[source,json]
----
{
  "server_url": "neo4j+s://xxxx.databases.neo4j.io",
  "database": "neo4j",
  "auth_type": "none"
}
----
=====

[.include-with-kerberos-auth]
=====
The Kerberos authentication scheme requires a base64-encoded ticket.
It can only be used if the server has the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/kerberos-add-on/current/deployment/[Kerberos Add-on installed].

[source,json]
----
{
  "server_url": "neo4j+s://xxxx.databases.neo4j.io",
  "database": "neo4j",
  "auth_type": "kerberos",
  "ticket": "<base 64 encoded Kerberos ticket>"
}
----
=====

[.include-with-bearer-auth]
=====
The bearer authentication scheme requires a base64-encoded token provided by an Identity Provider through Neo4j's link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/sso-integration[Single Sign-On feature].

[source,json]
----
{
  "server_url": "neo4j+s://xxxx.databases.neo4j.io",
  "database": "neo4j",
  "auth_type": "bearer",
  "token": "<bearer token>"
}
----
=====

[.include-with-custom-auth]
=====
To log into a server having a custom authentication scheme.

[source,json]
----
{
  "server_url": "neo4j+s://xxxx.databases.neo4j.io",
  "database": "neo4j",
  "auth_type": "custom",
  "principal": "<principal>",
  "credentials": "<credentials>",
  "realm": "<realm>",
  "scheme": "<scheme>",
  "parameters": {"<key>": "<value>"}
}

The connection file can be uploaded either as a secret to Google Cloud Secret Manager or directly into your Google Cloud Storage bucket:

1. link:https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager[*Google Secret Manager*] -- Create a new secret and upload the `neo4j-connection-info.json` file as value.
2. link:https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/[*Google Cloud Storage*] -- Upload the `neo4j-connection-info.json` file to your Cloud Storage bucket.

// end::connection-info[]


// tag::gcs-bucket[]
== Google Cloud Storage bucket

You need a link:https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/[Google Cloud Storage] bucket.
This is the one and only location from where the Dataflow job can source files (both configuration files and source CSVs, if any).
// end::gcs-bucket[]


// tag::dataflow-job[]
== Google Dataflow job

The link:https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow[Google Dataflow] job glues all the pieces together and performs the data import.
You need to craft a _job specification_ file to provide Dataflow with all the information it needs to load the data into Neo4j.

[NOTE]
All Google-related resources (Cloud project, Cloud Storage buckets, Dataflow job) should either belong to the same account, or to one which the Dataflow job has permissions to access.

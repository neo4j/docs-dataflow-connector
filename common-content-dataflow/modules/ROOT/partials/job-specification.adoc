= Create a job specification file

tag::intro[]

The job configuration file instructs Dataflow on how to run the import (where to source the data from, how to map it into Neo4j, etc).
It consists of a JSON object with four sections.

.Job specification JSON skeleton
[source, JSON]
----
{
  "version": "1",
  "config": { ... },  // <1>
  "sources": [  // <2>
    { ... }
  ],
  "targets": [  // <3>
    { ... }
  ],
  "actions": [  // <4>
    { ... }
  ]
}
----

<1> `config` -- Global flags affecting how the import is performed (optional)
<2> `sources` -- Data source definitions (relational)
<3> `targets` -- Data target definitions (graph: nodes/relationships/Cypher queries)
<4> `actions` -- One-off actions (optional)

At a high level, the job fetches data from `sources` and transforms/imports them into the `targets`.

A valid specification file contains **at least** one source object and one target object.

end::intro[]


tag::full-example[]

[#full-example]
== A full example

Here below is an example job specification file that works out of the box to import the publicly-available `movies` dataset.

The dataset contains entities `Person` and `Movie`, linked together by `DIRECTED` and `ACTED_IN` relationships.
In other words, each `Person` may have `DIRECTED` and/or `ACTED_IN` a `Movie`.
Both entities and relationships have extra details attached to each of them.
The data is sourced from the following files: xref:common-content-dataflow:ROOT:attachment$persons.csv[persons.csv], xref:common-content-dataflow:ROOT:attachment$movies.csv[movies.csv], xref:common-content-dataflow:ROOT:attachment$acted_in.csv[acted_in.csv], xref:common-content-dataflow:ROOT:attachment$directed.csv[directed.csv].

The next sections break it down and provide in-context information for each part.
We recommend reading this guide side by side with the job specification example.

tag::configuration[]

[#configuration]
== Configuration

The `config` object contains global configuration for the import job.
All settings have a default, so you don't need to specify them unless you wish to alter them.

- `node_target_batch_size` (int) -- Number of rows to be processed for each node target's import transaction.
- `relationship_target_batch_size` (int) -- Number of rows to be processed for each relationship target's transaction.

- `relationship_target_parallelism` (int) -- Number of max concurrent transactions for relationship targets per worker. Values higher than `1` should be set with care, as they may result in deadlocks.
- `query_target_parallelism` (int) -- Number of max concurrent transactions for Cypher query targets per worker. Values higher than `1` should be set with care, as they may result in deadlocks.

end::configuration[]


tag::targets[]

[#targets]
== Targets

The `targets` section contains the definitions of the graph entities that will result from the import.

You must specify **at least** one target object.

Neo4j represents objects with link:https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/appendix/graphdb-concepts/#graphdb-node[nodes] (ex. `movies`, `people`) and connects them with link:https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/appendix/graphdb-concepts/#graphdb-relationship[relationships] (ex. `ACTED_IN`, `DIRECTED`).
Each object in the targets section will generate a corresponding entity (node or relationship) in Neo4j drawing data from a source.
It is also possible to run custom Cypher queries.

.Targets specification skeleton
[source, JSON]
----
"targets": {
  "nodes": [ ... ],
  "relationships": [ ... ],
  "queries": [ ... ]
}
----

By default, **you don't need to think about dependencies between nodes and relationships**.
Relationship targets are always processed after the targets corresponding to their start and end node.
It is however possible to add other targets as dependencies.


[#node-objects]
=== Node objects

Node entities must be grouped in a list keyed `nodes` inside the `targets` object.

.Node targets specification skeleton

----
"targets": {
  "nodes": [
    { <nodeSpec1> },
    { <nodeSpec2> },

[#node-compulsory-fields]
==== Compulsory fields

Each node object must at minimum have attributes `source`, `name`, `labels`, and `properties`.

- `properties` (list of objects) -- Mapping between source columns and node properties. +
Valid values for `target_property_type` are: `boolean`, `byte_array` (assumes base64 encoding), `date`, `duration`, `float`, `integer`, `local_date`, `local_datetime`, `local_time`, `point`, `string`, `zoned_datetime`, `zoned_time`.
{target_property_type-valid-values-extra}
- `write_mode` (string) -- The creation mode in Neo4j. Either `create` or `merge`. See link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/create/[`CREATE`] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/merge/[`MERGE`] for info on the Cypher clauses behavior.


[#node-schema]
==== Schema definition

You may create link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/indexes/[indexes] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/constraints/[constraints] on the imported nodes through the `schema` object.
The schema setup is equivalent to manually running the relevant `CREATE INDEX/CONSTRAINT` commands, except they are run automatically ahead of import for each entity type.

[TIP]
If the global config `index_all_properties` is set to `true`, all properties will be indexed with range indexes.

When present, it is optional, except for vector indexes where it is mandatory.

[WARNING]
**Source data must not have null values for `key_constraints` columns**, or they will clash with the node key constraint.
If the source is not clean in this respect, think of cleaning it upfront in the related `source.query` field by excluding all rows that wouldn't fulfill the constraints (ex. `WHERE person_tmbdId IS NOT NULL`).
Alternatively, use the `where` attribute in a xref:source-transformations[source transformation].

[IMPORTANT]
The options `key_constraints` and `existence_constraints` require Neo4j/Aura Enterprise Edition, and do not have any effect when run against a Neo4j Community Edition installation.

[#query-targets]
=== Custom query targets

Custom query targets are useful when the import requires a complex query that does not easily fit into the node/relationship targets format.
Query targets receive batches of rows through the variable `$rows`.

Custom queries must be grouped in a list keyed `queries` inside the `targets` object.

[WARNING]
Do not use custom queries to run Cypher that does not directly depend on a source; use xref:actions[actions] instead.
One-off queries, especially if not idempotent, are not fit to use in custom query targets.
The reason for this is that queries from targets are run in batches, so a custom query may be run several times depending on the number of `$rows` batches extracted from the source.

[#source-transformations]
== Source transformations

Each node and relationship target can optionally have a `source_transformation` attribute containing aggregation functions. This can be useful to extract higher-level dimensions from a more granular source. Aggregations result in extra fields that become available for property mappings.

[#actions]
== Actions

The `actions` section contains commands that can be run before or after specific steps of the import process.
Each step is called a `stage`.
You may for example submit HTTP requests when steps complete, execute SQL queries on the source, or run Cypher statements on the Neo4j target instance.

  "actions": [
    { <actionSpec1> },
    { <actionSpec2> },
    ...
  ]

Each action object must at minimum have the attribute `name`, `type`, and `stage`.
Further attributes depend on the action type.

== Variables

////
Key-values can be supplied in Dataflow to replace `$` delimited tokens.
You can provide parameters in the `Options JSON` field when creating the Dataflow job, as a JSON object.
Variable interpolation works in:

- BigQuery source query (SQL)
- Text source URL
- Custom Cypher target query
- BigQuery action SQL
- Cypher action query
- HTTP GET/POST URL and header values.

Variables must be prefixed by the `$` symbol (ex. `$limit`), and may be used in job specification files and in `readQuery` or `inputFilePattern` (source URI) xref:cli.adoc[command-line] parameters.
////

Variables are not supported yet.

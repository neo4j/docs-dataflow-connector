[#sources]
== Sources

The `sources` section contains the definitions of the data sources, as a list. As a rough guideline, you can think `+one table <=> one source+`. The importer will take the data surfaced by the sources and make it available to the targets, which will eventually map it into Neo4j.

.Source object specification and its defaults
[source, json]
----
{
  "type": "bigquery",
  "name": "<sourceName>",
  "query": "<bigQuerySqlQuery>"
}
----

- `type` (string) -- `bigquery`.
- `name` (string) -- A human-friendly label for the source (unique among all names; may not contain spaces). You will use this to reference the source from other parts of the specification file.
- `query` (string) -- The dataset to extract from BigQuery, as an SQL query. Notice that:

  1. the source table can have more columns than what you select in the query;
  2. multiple targets can use the same source, potentially filtering it for a different subset of columns.

[WARNING]
Columns of type `BIGNUMERIC`, `GEOGRAPHY`, `JSON`, `INTERVAL` and `STRUCT` are not supported.

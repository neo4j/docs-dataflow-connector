= Introduction

The Flex Template allows to import data from a BigQuery dataset into a Neo4j database, through a Dataflow job.
It also allows to manipulate and transform the data at various steps of the import.
You can use the template for both first-time and incremental imports.

This guide walks you through how to import an example BigQuery dataset into a Neo4j database using a Dataflow job.
It also provides a public dataset you can experiment with, before you go on and create an import job for you own dataset.

[NOTE]
To import data from CSV files rather than BigQuery, checkout the xref:{page-component-version}@dataflow-google-cloud::index.adoc[Dataflow Flex Template for Google Cloud to Neo4j].

== Dataset to import

You need a link:https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery[Google BigQuery] dataset that you want to import into Neo4j.
This guide provides you with one to get started with.

[TIP]
Since you are moving data from a relational database into a graph database, **the data model is likely to change**.
Checkout link:https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/data-modeling/guide-data-modeling/[Graph data modeling guidelines] to learn how to model for graph databases.

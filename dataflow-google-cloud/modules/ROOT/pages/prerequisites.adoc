=== Google Cloud Storage bucket

You need a link:https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/[Google Cloud Storage] bucket.
This is the one and only location from where the Dataflow job can source files (both configuration files and source CSVs, if any).

Unless you stored the credentials file in Google Secret Manager, go ahead and upload the `neo4j-connection-info.json` file to your Cloud Storage bucket.

== Dataset to import

You need a dataset that you want to import into Neo4j.
This should consist of a number of CSV files located in your Google Cloud Storage bucket.

This tutorial uses a subset of the `movies` dataset.
It contains entities `Person` and `Movie`, linked together by `DIRECTED` and `ACTED_IN` relationships.
In other words, each `Person` may have `DIRECTED` and/or `ACTED_IN` a `Movie`.
Both entities and relationships have extra details attached to each of them.
The data is sourced from the following files: xref:common-content-dataflow:ROOT:attachment$persons.csv[persons.csv], xref:common-content-dataflow:ROOT:attachment$movies.csv[movies.csv], xref:common-content-dataflow:ROOT:attachment$acted_in.csv[acted_in.csv], xref:common-content-dataflow:ROOT:attachment$directed.csv[directed.csv].

[TIP]
Since you are moving data from a relational database into a graph database, **the data model will have to change**.
Checkout link:https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/data-modeling/guide-data-modeling/[Graph data modeling guidelines] to learn how to model for graph databases.

== Dataset to import

You need a dataset that you want to import into Neo4j.
This should consist of a number of CSV files located in your Google Cloud Storage bucket.

This tutorial uses a subset of the `movies` dataset.
It contains entities `Person` and `Movie`, linked together by `DIRECTED` and `ACTED_IN` relationships.
In other words, each `Person` may have `DIRECTED` and/or `ACTED_IN` a `Movie`.
Both entities and relationships have extra details attached to each of them.
The data is sourced from the following files: xref:common-content-dataflow:ROOT:attachment$persons.csv[persons.csv], xref:common-content-dataflow:ROOT:attachment$movies.csv[movies.csv], xref:common-content-dataflow:ROOT:attachment$acted_in.csv[acted_in.csv], xref:common-content-dataflow:ROOT:attachment$directed.csv[directed.csv].

[TIP]
Since you are moving data from a relational database into a graph database, **the data model will have to change**.

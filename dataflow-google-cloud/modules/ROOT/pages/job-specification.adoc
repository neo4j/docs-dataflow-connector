== Sources

The `sources` section contains the definitions of the data sources, as a list. As a rough guideline, you can think `+one table <=> one source+`. The importer will leverage the data surfaced by the sources and make it available to the targets, which eventually map it into Neo4j.

To import data from a CSV file, six attributes are compulsory.

[source, json]
----
{
  "type": "text",
  "name": "movies",
  "uri": "<path-to-csv>",
  "format": "EXCEL",
  "delimiter": ",",
  "ordered_field_names": "movieId,title"
}
----

- `type` (string) -- `text`.
- `name` (string) -- a human-friendly label for the source (unique among all sources). You will use this to reference the source in the targets section.
- `uri` (string) -- the Google Storage location of the CSV file (ex. `gs://neo4j-datasets/movies.csv`).
- `format` (string) -- any of link:https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/apidocs/org/apache/commons/csv/CSVFormat.html[Apache's `CSVFormat`] predefined formats.
- `delimiter` (string) -- CSV field delimiter.
- `ordered_field_names` (string) -- list of field names the CSV file contains, in order.

.How to retrieve the Google Storage location of a file?

====

CSV files must fulfill some constraints:

- **they should not contain headers**. Column names should be specified in the `ordered_field_names` attributes, and files should contain data rows only.
- they should not contain empty rows.
